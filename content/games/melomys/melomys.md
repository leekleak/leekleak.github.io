I'm gonna be honest. Making a metroidvania for a game jam is a very very stupid idea. Even more so if you want to hand-craft the world without any procedural generation and have it be made up of bespoke puzzle and platforming challenges.

Working with a team of friends was pretty fun, but I feel like I was quite a poor manager as at the end of the day I put more man-hours into this than the rest of the team combined. That's not to say that that the project would have been possible without them - I'm especially happy to have had help with art and sound as those are the two things I'm not too good at.

However the experience does make me wonder how the game design process goes on in even larger teams (By larger I mean more than 5 people. Incredible, I know). Ok, I'm kidding. I know how it works. It doesn't. At the time of writing this I just so happened to be working in a team of around five other game designers and it's almost impossible to do anything. It's been three weeks of discussion and we've barely finished discussing whether the game will be 2D or 3D.

Anyway, that does make me think how in these 3 weeks I could have made a Melomys 2 or somthing like that.
